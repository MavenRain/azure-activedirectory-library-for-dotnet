## How to Run Tests

The majority of tests in this repo are mstests which run either as unit tests (with TestCategory 'AdalDotNetUnit' or 'AdalWinRTUnit') or as end to end test running against a mock service (with TestCategory 'AdalDotNetMock' or 'AdalWinRTMock'). 
These tests are self contained and can run either using Test Explorer in Visual Studio or command line tool mstest.exe.

To run the rest of the tests, you need to create an account on Azure Active Directory (AAD) and/or setup your own ADFS server and then configure them with configurations in file STS.cs.
